<p class"jcb">When we think of social networks what comes to mind?  Facebook or MySpace or maybe even flickr, but all of these are similar in one way;
they make access to many different people easy and right at your finger tips.  Sometimes these networks can have a lasting impact, either positive or negative, on peoples lives.
The wrong picture or friends on there can land you in huge trouble with the law or with your employer.
One of my best friends just got kicked off of the soccer team at his college because he was seen on facebook holding a can of beer while being underage.
No body thinks that these sites can do any harm but in reality they really can.</p>

<p class="below_gap">Some countries like Korea are advocating that everyone become involved in social networks like facebook and twitter because they feel it builds trust as a society.
They do not want the people of their country having private chats because they feel it is not building trustSocial networks are limiting face to face conversations and human interaction.
People are becoming so engulfed with facebook and twitter that their health is actually declining because of it!
Obesity is the biggest problem facing this country and it will just get worse if people choose to conversate over facebook rather than take a walk in a park or by the river.
Things happen differently and people make better connections in person to person conversations rather than over the "web".</p>
